        <p>"We live full-time in our RV, so reliable repairs are everything to us. 
        Richard has worked on our rig twice now, and both times he went above and beyond. He’s the only one we trust.</p> <span class="author">-Marlene Granger"</span>

        <p>"What impressed me most was Richard’s attention to detail.
         He didn’t just fix the issue, he explained everything in plain language and made sure I understood how to prevent it in the future.</p><span class="author">-Eric Sanchez"</span>

         <p>"As a new RV owner, I had no idea what I was doing when something broke.
         Richard was patient, honest, and treated me with respect. I won’t call anyone else for repairs.</p><span class="author">-Katherine Spruce"</span>

         
         <p>"I had a water leak right before a big family trip. 
        Richard showed up the same day and fixed it fast. Thanks to him, our vacation went on as scheduled.</p><span class="author">-Dave Thompson"</span>
